#CH3: the 3 equation model and Macro policy


If unemployment is at the equilibrium rate, then inflation will remain constant and the central bank will do nothing. 

If unemployment is below the eq rate, inflation is rising and vice versa for unemployment above it. An increase in inflation above the central bank's target will trigger intervention by the central bank: it will raise the interest rate. A fall in inflation below target will trigger an easing of monetary policy with lower interest rate. 


###Inflation and deflation

the return on holding notes and coins is zero. so with any positive inflation rate, the return in real terms is negative. 

This is not to say that deflation is optimal or even healthy. 

We need to avoid a deflation trap. 

deflation also increases real debt burdens. 


###Intro to 3 equation model

The 3 equation model is produced by adding the Monetary Rule (MR), curve to the IS curve from the demand side and the Phillips curve (PC) from the supply side. 

The economy is affected by shocks to demand and supply, which affect output and inflation. An unforeseen boom, for example, which takes output above equilibrium, will increase inflation above the target as the position of workers in the labour market strengthens. This aspect of wage behaviour is captured in the Phillips Curve.
