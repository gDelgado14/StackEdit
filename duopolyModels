#Cournot Model

Industry competes on output, which each incumbent deceides on independently of each other.

Features of the industry: 

* Homogenous product
* No collusion
* Each firm's output decision affects the good's price
* fixed number of firms
* firms compete in quantities, and choose quantities simultanously
* firms seek to maximize profit

for every output choice by the incumbent, the entrant firm, is shown to have a unique profit maximizing response and vice versa. The graph representations of these responses is called Reaction Curves. 

We assume that the industry (consisting of two firms) *inverse* demand curve is linear and can be described by: 

$$ P = A - BQ = A - B (q_1+ q_2) $$

where Q is the sum of each firm's production. 

We assume the both firms have the same constant marginal cost of production, $c$.

When finding optimal profit quantities, each firm takes their respective counterpart's output as given and adjusts its own output accordingly. 

The monopoly profit maximizing output quantity condition applies: 

$$MR = MC = c$$

Using the above condition we get each firm's *reaction function* ... 

$$q_2^* =  \frac{(A - c)}{2B} - \frac{q_1}{2}$$

---

$$q_1^* =  \frac{(A - c)}{2B} - \frac{q_2}{2}$$

> Substitute $q_2^*$ into $q_1^*$ to get the *Cournot-Nash* equilibrium level of output. 



#Bertrand Model

Incumbents compete by setting prices as opposed to output levels.

All other assumptions remain unchanged. Each firm produces the same good at the same constant marginal cost $c$, and the firms choose their strategies simultaneously. Again, market demand is denoted as 

$$P = A - BQ$$

In this case, it's more convenient to write the demand function with output as the dependent variable. Hence: 

$$Q = a - bP$$
Where $a = \frac{A}{B}$ and $b = \frac{1}{B}$

Considering that the market is for a homogenous good, if one price is less than another, then buyers will buy strictly from the cheapest source. So at equilibrium, market demand is evenly split amongst all incumbents at a constant price. 

Thus we can denote firm 2's output as follows: 

$q_2 = 0 \qquad \qquad \text{ if } \quad p_2 > p1$
$q_2 = \frac{a-bp_2}{2} \qquad \text{ if } \quad p_2 = p1$
$q_2 = a - bp_2 \qquad \text{ if } \quad p_2 < p1$


The demand functions for either firm are thus not continuous. Therefore, profits are not continuous either.
