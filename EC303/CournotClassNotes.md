### Nov 16, 2015

* Cournot mergers are cost savings if either VC or FC savings are large
* Profitable mergers rasise welfare
	* If all we had was cournot mergers, it woudlnt be necessary to regulate the market
* Stackelberg mergers which create a leader are always profitable even without cost efficiency gains
*  Leader / follower mergers are **always** profitable even without cost efficiencies
* Leader forllower mergers lower welfare if there are no cost efficiency gains 
	* In other words ... leader follower mergers are always profitable and always lower welfare when there are no cost efficiency gains 
* Stackelberg mergers that create a leader increase welfare if there are few leaders and lower welfare if there are many leaders
